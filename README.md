# GEOMANIA

**Geomania** is an educational project developed using the **Dr. Racket** programming language. This project was created as the Term Project for the **CMPE 100: Introduction to Computing** course at **İstanbul Bilgi University** (Fall 2024/2025).

## 📖 About the Project

**Geomania** aims to teach and practice geography knowledge for primary school students through gamification. The project consists of 3 different mini-games focusing on "Regions of Türkiye", "Continents", and "Finding Cardinal Directions".

The main goal is to help students gain direction awareness and knowledge about their environment in a fun and interactive way.

## 🎮 Game Modes

The project includes three distinct mini-games:

### 1. Marco Polo (Continents)
* **Goal:** Learn the locations of the continents on Earth.
* **How to Play:** Players are shown a blank world map and given continent names in a random order. The player must click on the correct continent before the time runs out.
* **Winning:** The game ends when the player answers 7 questions correctly.

### 2. Region Discovery (Regions of Türkiye)
* **Goal:** Master the geographical regions of Türkiye.
* **How to Play:** Players are given names of different regions (e.g., Marmara, Akdeniz) one at a time and must select the correct region on the map.
* **Features:** Includes a timer to track completion speed, motivating players to improve their scores.

### 3. Treasure Hunt (Cardinal Directions)
* **Goal:** Gain direction awareness (North, South, West, East).
* **How to Play:** The game features an $9 \times 9$ grid (81 boxes). Players start from the middle box and must follow specific directions (e.g., "4 steps South, 2 steps West") to find the box containing gold.
* **Challenge:** Players must be careful not to open empty boxes!
